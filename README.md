# @Todo
- Hidden Guesses Mode
- Singleplayer mode WORLD
- Shared Multiplayer mode

## Hidden Guesses Mode

The idea: when entering guesses they are hidden, maybe like in a password field, that you can at least see the length the other player guesses or maybe completely hidden that you don’t even see the length. This would be chosable at game selection

## Singleplayer mode WORLD

The idea: you can select single player mode and play against other users that play right now on the same channel.

## Shared Multiplayer mode

The idea: you get a game url/channel that you can share with friends so they can connect with their devices to place guesses.
